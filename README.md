# StupedBax
<br />

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
I built a completely useless box.
It's purpose is nothing but switching off a button.
Programmed by using interrupts in the Arduino IDE. 
In the future I'd like to add a motion sensor for extra fun :-)
### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

* Atmega328 (Programmed with Arduino Nano)
* 2x SG90 Servo
* 1x Switch button
* 1x IRF9Z34 MOSFET P-channel
* 1x 10k resistor
* Jump wires
